If you add some crucial changes like pages, nav change, footer change or whatever else that will affect everyone else work commit the changes directly to the main branch with some description what has been changed.
Other than that, create a separate branch with the name that indicates your particular task and commit all the changes in there. 
When everybody will finish we will merge all the branches in main branch and that will be our final project.
